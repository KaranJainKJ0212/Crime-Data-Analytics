# Crime-Data-Analytics

**Capstone Project II, IIT Kanpur**

**Tech Stack:**  
- **Python:** pandas, statsmodels, matplotlib  
- **MS Excel:** PivotTables, Power Query Editor  
- **Data:** CSV workflows

## Key Highlights

- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
  – Standardized 12 years (2001–2012) of NCRB district-level crime data using Excel PivotTables & Power Query Editor  
  – Transformed raw reports into a clean year–district matrix and exported to CSV

- **Time-Series Forecasting**  
  – Implemented Holt-Winters additive exponential smoothing in Python (`statsmodels`)  
  – Forecasted crime counts for 2013–2020 with MAPE ≈ 8.7% and > 85% of districts under 10% error

- **Analysis Pipeline**  
  – Built a reproducible workflow combining Python scripts (`pandas`, `matplotlib`) with Excel dashboards  
  – Automated data validation, interactive charting, and stakeholder reporting

- **Dimensionality Reduction**  
  – Performed PCA in Python to compress 20+ crime categories into 3 principal components (≈ 98% variance explained)  
  – Uncovered latent patterns for category-agnostic trend analysis

- **Trend Quantification**  
  – Calculated district-level trend slopes via linear regression in Python  
  – Identified emerging hotspots and informed proactive resource allocation

- **Insights & Reporting**  
  – Delivered actionable visualizations in both Excel and Python  
  – Generated policy recommendations and proactive policing strategies
